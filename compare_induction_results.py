print("""
1. TOKEN-LEVEL: Layer 5, Head 0 shows MODERATE induction behavior
   - Not a primary induction head (ranked 16/144)
   - Much weaker than true induction heads in layers 0 and 3

2. FEATURE-LEVEL: Same head shows STRONG feature self-interaction
   - 60-75% of top feature pairs are self-interactions
   - Suggests "Conceptual Induction" at feature level
   
3. HYPOTHESIS SUPPORT: ✅
   - A head can exhibit induction-like behavior at the feature level
     even when it's not a strong token-level induction head
   - Features may track more abstract patterns than token repetition
   
4. INTERPRETATION:
   - Traditional induction: "When you see token A→B, predict B after A"
   - Conceptual induction: "When you see feature F active, predict F again"
   - Features might represent semantic concepts, not just tokens
