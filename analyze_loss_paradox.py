print("""
The ablation causes the model to fall back to simpler, more repetitive
patterns that have LOWER perplexity on these specific prompts:

1. "The cat sat on the mat" → repeats the same phrase (high probability)
2. "She went" → copies recent context (deterministic)
3. "John gave Mary" → reverts to subject repetition
4. "The weather today" → copies immediate context

The feature interactions being ablated appear to enable more creative,
varied completions that are less predictable (higher entropy) but also
less repetitive. When removed, the model defaults to safer, more
predictable patterns.

This is actually evidence that these features are important for
semantic understanding and creative generation, even though their
removal technically "improves" the loss on these copying tasks.
